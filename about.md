##About Me
Hi! My name is Roland Lazarte. I’m a cinematographer/director of photography. I also like to say image-maker. Basically, it’s my mission to create moving images, as in images that move people. In 2012 I graduated from New York University, where I majored in Film and TV Arts and minored in Asian American Studies. Since graduating, I’ve worked at several film festivals, mentored high school students in filmmaking, and shot a short film in the Philippines. I’m currently based in Los Angeles, but I’ll follow the right project anywhere.

If you want to make something awesome and think I’m right for your project, please get in touch. I’d love to hear about it!  

##What’s Aninag?
*Aninag* (adj.) visible, transparent, translucent (n.) reflection  
I can’t remember where I first read the word, but I think it was in a Tagalog poem I read for class. It’s a sticky word for me because of its meaning. The definition I like best emerges when the word is broken[^1] into its parts “anihin ang sinag,” which means “catch the light.” 

[^1]: It’s common in Tagalog to combine words into a portmanteau. For example, Tapsilog = tapa + sinangag + itlog, which is a breakfest meal consisting of a meat, garlic fried rice, and fried egg. Just like banana + coffee = banofee.
